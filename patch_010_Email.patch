Subject: [PATCH] Email: Declare GET_WIDGET_UPDATE permission

A new permission for E-mail widget updates was introduced as ASB patch,
but it has been missed to actually declare its usage in the manifest.

When an attempt was made to add it to the home screen, it was not
possible to get the e-mails of the selected folder displayed.

Test: Add E-Mail widget to home screen and try to configure it.
